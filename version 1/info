files inculded here are for design version 1

it doesn't have " usb hub" functionality currently

2020-08-26 version 1 is created, has 3 usb ports, mosfet is rated for 3 amps, external power supply notifies the MCU which can allow increased current alotment in programming. eg: max 500ma under usb input vs max 5A (shared by all ports) under power supply usage (current limited by dc-dc converter)

INA219 shunt is 0.1ohm 1% toleance which allows for sense current up to 3.2Amps.

LTC4412 sense pin output needs to be confirmed for voltage tolerance on MCU pin A0

board allows for buttons to be placed and allows for software control of outputs -- newpixels give the ability to iniicate status of ports. 4 pin header spot has been added for the use of an I2C LCD.

current design allows for various arengments of a custom 3D printed case that allows the hub to me mounted in various ways

current board size is 100*75mm

posibility of adding I2C port expander to increase amount of usb ports / possible mosfet controllable power cut off.

next designs will hopefully include "hub" functionality.
